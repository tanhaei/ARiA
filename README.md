ARiA (A Framework to Perform Refactoring on the Software Architecture)

Performing refactoring on the SA is a good way to in- crease software quality before implementation. Identifica- tion of software pitfalls before implementation decreases the cost of development drastically. Avoiding the known bad smells in designing architecture and applying appro- priate SA styles and patterns decreases the likelihood of project failure and increases the satisfaction of the stake- holders. Based on the above mentioned benefits, perform- ing refactoring before going into implementation phase is quite advisable.
